## ORCID ID

ORCID stands for Open Research and Contributor ID. It is another type of persistent identifier, like a DOI. An ORCID ID is assigned to an individual researcher or contributor. It serves as a reliable digital identifier that distinguishes one researcher from another, regardless of name variations or affiliations, and links them to their scholarly and research activities.  

ORCIDs play a crucial role in promoting transparency, recognition and attribution in academic research. By using ORCID IDs, researchers can take ownership of their scholarly output, establish a clear identity in the academic community, and receive proper credit for their contributions.

ORCIDS provide author disambiguation, reducing the chances of misidentification and ensuring that researchers receive due recognition for their work. The adoption of ORCID IDs has become increasingly prevalent in the academic world, fostering collaboration, facilitating research assessment, and enhancing the reliability and integrity of scholarly communications.  

The ORCID ID profile of scholarly and research activities can be currated manually. However, software systems have been developed to automatically search, retrieve and collate scholarly and research activities tagged with personal ORCIDs. There are multiple publicly accessible software systems available that, together, provide an ecosystem of databases, access points and interfaces to discover and collate information tagged with PIDs. If a research has an ORCID, these systems can automatically populate and maintain a profile of works by the researcher. 

[VIVO](https://vivo.lyrasis.org/) and [Symplectic Elements](https://www.symplectic.co.uk/theelementsplatform/) are two open source software systems that can be integrated together and customised to provide an institution-specific service, pulling in data from Dimensions, Scopus, Web of Science, and ORCID. These systems can provide an expertise discovery gateway to facilitate collaboration among academic researchers and spark increased engagement with other communities in academia, industry, and the media, locally, nationally, and internationally.
