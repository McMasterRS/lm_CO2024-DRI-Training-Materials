## Introduction to Minimal Computing

Minimal computing is the idea of doing the most with the least technology possible, computing done under some set of significant constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, power, or other factors. Minimal computing emphasizes simplicity, efficiency, and a focus on the essential elements needed to accomplish a task or project. It seeks to make digital resources more available, particularly in constrained environments or for individuals and communities with limited access to high-end computing infrastructure.  

In the context of web development, minimal computing often involves the use of static site generators and tools that reduce the reliance to heavy processing on server side and client side and the dependency on complex infrastructures (e.g. databases). That being said, minimal computing is not always the perfect pathway in web development. Due to the limited faunctionality, minimal computing techniques can hardly be used in featureful website. However, with minimal computing techniques, developers can create websites that are fast and responsive, more secure and easier to maintain.  

Here are some fo the key benefits of minimal computing in web development,  

- **Simplicity**, Use straightforward web technologies, like plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and avoid the unnecessary complexity that comes with using large development frameworks or libraries.  
- **Efficiency**, Optimize resources to ensure fast load times and minimal server load, by optimizing imagery assets and minimizing HTTP requests.  
- **Accessibility**, Ensure web applications are accessible to users with different levels of internet connectivity and device capabilities.
